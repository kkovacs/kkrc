# scancodemap-ultimate.reg

Scancode map that does:

- Sets Caps Lock to Right Ctrl.
- Sets Left Win to Left Alt.
- Sets Menu to Left Win. (In case there is no Right Win button and we still need the functionality.)

This registry file only replaces Caps Lock with Right Ctrl.

# Open_File_Explorer_to_Downloads.reg

This registry file makes Windows Explorer open the "Downloads" folder instead
of whatever when a new window is opened.

NOTE: I usually use PowerToys "remap keys" instead of this, since that doesn't
come with installing a unusual EXE (usually frowned upon on corporate PCs) but
only PowerToys, which is a more easily defensible Microsoft product.

Windows keyboard layout similar to MacOS's "ABC Extended" (was "US Extended")
keyboard, regarding my language's accented characters.

To be used with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) from:

It's not a perfect match because I can set up "dead key" accents only on AltGr.
Because of this, I also use Microsoft PowerToys to redefine for example WIN+E
to AltGr+E, etc.

An alternative is to use the "Romanian (Developer)" keyboard, which is
basically US but has all the dead keys, even if in wrong places. That can be
fixed with Microsoft PowerToys though.
