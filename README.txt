This directory contains some configuration files that I like to use, and
recently I got tired of copying them around to all machines and user accounts I
have.

This newer version uses soft-links instead of copying files around. Works on
the user level (it was tedious and error-prone to maintain the system-level
variations between various operating systems, distributions, etc.)

To install:

git clone https://github.com/kkovacs/kkrc/ ~/.kkrc; ~/.kkrc/install.sh
